###Directory structure
`robot-thing` is the code for the robot
`config` is the constants file that needs to get uploaded to the robot
`testing` is full of unit tests
I don't know what RemoteSystemTestFiles is and at this point I'm afraid to delete it :'(

###Unit tests
To run the unit tests, you need the CUTE eclipse plugin.  It might not work out of the box (eclipse using absolute paths by default) so ask Andrew for help.
