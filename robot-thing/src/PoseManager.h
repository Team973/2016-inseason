/*
 * PoseManager.h
 *
 * PoseManager reads a configuration file... there's an example configuration file
 * in {repository-root}/config/presets.json.  Upload a file like this to the
 * home directory on the robot.
 *
 * Optional:  if you make changes to the presets.json file, you can run check.py
 * and it will check it for typos and type-errors.  I don't know what PoseManager
 * will do in the event of one of these errors.  In my experience, it fails
 * silently (looking into it).  So if it fails weirdly, try running check.py and
 * it'll tell you if there's a problem in the config file.
 *
 * At the moment, these are the controls:
 * 	driverJoystick.buttonX -> Chill (stop moving the motors)
 * 	driverJoystick.buttonY -> Go to the next pose in the list
 * 					if you hit the end of the list, wrap back around to the beginning
 * 					don't actually move the motors to the pose, just select it.  The motors
 * 							will move when you "Assume pose"
 * 	driverJoystick.rightTrigger -> Assume pose
 * 					Actually start moving the motors to get to the pose position.
